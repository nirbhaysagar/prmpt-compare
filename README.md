# ‚öñÔ∏è PromptCompare ‚Äî The AI Prompt Optimization Platform

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 26, 2025

## üåç Vision & Mission

**Vision:** To become the essential platform for developers and prompt engineers to systematically evaluate, compare, and optimize prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Mission:** Provide an intuitive, data-driven workflow for A/B testing AI prompts, enabling users to find the most effective instructions to achieve high-quality, reliable, and efficient outputs from models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude.

**Motto:** "Find the words that work."

## üí° The Problem: Prompt Engineering Guesswork

Getting the best results from LLMs requires effective "prompt engineering." However, this process is often based on intuition and manual trial-and-error:

- **Subjectivity:** It's hard to objectively determine which prompt variation truly performs better across multiple runs.
- **Inefficiency:** Manually running prompts, copying outputs, and comparing them side-by-side is incredibly time-consuming.
- **Lack of Systemization:** There's no easy way to track experiments, compare results systematically, or collaborate on prompt optimization.
- **Model Differences:** The best prompt for GPT-4 might not be the best for Gemini 1.5. Comparing across models is crucial but cumbersome.
- **Cost & Quality Trade-offs:** Optimizing prompts can significantly impact API costs and output quality, but measuring this trade-off is difficult.

Developers and teams need a structured way to move from prompt guesswork to data-driven prompt optimization.

## üß© The Solution: Systematic Prompt A/B Testing

PromptCompare is a web-based platform that streamlines the entire prompt evaluation workflow:

1. **Define Task & Variables:** Users define a specific task and input variables (e.g., `article_text` for summarization).
2. **Create Prompt Variations:** Users write multiple versions of the prompt they want to test.
3. **Select Models:** Users choose which LLMs to run the prompts against (initially using their own API keys).
4. **Run Experiment:** The platform runs each prompt variation against the selected models using the provided variables.
5. **Compare Outputs:** Outputs are displayed in a clean, side-by-side interface for easy visual comparison.
6. **Evaluate & Iterate:** Users can rate outputs, add notes, and use insights to refine their prompts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features & Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Side-by-Side Comparator (MVP - Target: 3 Weeks)

Goal: Launch a simple, shareable tool for comparing outputs from 2-3 prompt variations run against 1-2 major LLMs. Focus on the core comparison UI/UX.

- [‚úÖ] **Prompt Input Interface:**
  - UI to define a task (optional description).
  - Input fields for 2-3 prompt variations, allowing template variables (e.g., `{{article_text}}`).
  - Input field for variable values (e.g., pasting the actual article text).

- [‚úÖ] **LLM Integration (User API Key):**
  - Settings page for users to enter their own OpenAI API key (support GPT-4o-mini initially).
  - Backend logic to securely make API calls to the chosen LLM using the user's key.

- [‚úÖ] **Output Comparison View:**
  - A clean UI displaying the outputs from each prompt variation side-by-side for the same input variables.

- [‚úÖ] **Basic Rating:**
  - Simple "thumbs up / thumbs down" or 1-5 star rating for each output.

- [‚úÖ] **Shareable Links:**
  - Ability to generate a unique, public URL to share a specific comparison result (useful for team collaboration or public sharing). Store results temporarily.

- [‚úÖ] **Simple Deployment:**
  - Deploy frontend to Vercel, backend API (Node.js/Express) to Railway/Fly.io.

### Phase 2: SaaS Layer & Evaluation Metrics (Target: Q1 2026)

Goal: Add user accounts, persistent storage, more models, and basic automated evaluation metrics. Validate SaaS potential.

- [ ] **User Accounts & Persistent Storage:**
  - Add authentication (Supabase Auth or similar).
  - Store prompt experiments, results, and ratings persistently in a database (PostgreSQL/Prisma).

- [ ] **Project Organization:** Allow users to group experiments into projects.

- [ ] **Expanded LLM Support:** Add integrations for Gemini, Claude (still using user keys initially).

- [ ] **Basic Automated Metrics:**
  - Calculate and display simple metrics like output length (token count), execution time, and potentially keyword presence checks or regex matching.

- [ ] **Freemium & Pro Tiers:** Introduce limits (e.g., number of experiments, prompts per experiment) for free users and launch a paid Pro tier.

### Phase 3: Team Collaboration & Advanced Evaluation (Target: Mid-Late 2026)

Goal: Build features for teams and introduce more sophisticated evaluation methods.

- [ ] **Team Workspaces:** Allow teams to share experiments, prompts, and evaluation results.

- [ ] **Advanced Automated Evaluation:**
  - Integrate metrics like semantic similarity (using embedding models), ROUGE/BLEU scores (for specific tasks), or custom evaluation functions defined by the user.

- [ ] **Human Evaluation Workflow:** Tools to facilitate blind side-by-side comparisons by multiple team members.

- [ ] **Prompt Templating & Versioning:** Better tools for managing and iterating on a library of prompts.

- [ ] **Integration with LLM Platforms:** Connect with platforms like LangSmith or Weights & Biases for a more seamless MLOps workflow.

## üß± Technical Architecture & Stack (MVP Focus)

| Layer | Stack / Tools | Purpose & Rationale |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Frontend** | React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS | Modern UI, type safety, rapid styling. Need a good component for side-by-side text display/diffing. |
| **Backend** | Node.js & Express / NestJS | Handles orchestrating API calls to multiple LLMs, storing results temporarily for sharing. Async handling is important. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (e.g., Supabase/Railway) | Simple storage needed for MVP sharing links and temporary results. Can scale for user data in Phase 2. |
| **AI Models** | OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini, etc.) | Integrate via official SDKs. User provides API key in MVP. |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (Frontend), Railway/Fly.io (Backend) | Standard, easy deployment for this stack. |

**Key Architectural Decision:** Keep the MVP backend extremely simple. Its primary job is to securely receive user input + API key, call the external LLM APIs, and return the results. The complexity is in the frontend comparison UI. Store minimal data needed for sharing.

## üß≠ Build Roadmap (MVP Sprint - Target: 3 Weeks)

### Week 1: Core UI & Backend Setup.
- [ ] Set up Next.js frontend project.
- [ ] Design and build the basic UI layout: input fields for prompts and variables, placeholders for outputs.
- [ ] Set up Node.js/Express backend project.
- [ ] Build the core API endpoint that accepts prompts, variables, and an API key.

### Week 2: LLM Integration & Output Display.
- [ ] Implement backend logic to make calls to the OpenAI API using the provided key and prompts/variables.
- [ ] Connect the frontend to the backend API: Send inputs, receive outputs.
- [ ] Build the side-by-side output display component on the frontend.

### Week 3: Rating, Sharing & Deployment.
- [ ] Add simple rating buttons (UI only initially, or store temporarily).
- [ ] Implement the sharing mechanism: Save comparison data (prompts, inputs, outputs) to a simple DB (e.g., Supabase) and generate a unique URL. Ensure the URL correctly loads the comparison view.
- [ ] Polish UI/UX, add basic instructions.
- [ ] Deploy frontend and backend. Write README.md.
